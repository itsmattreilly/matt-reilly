  You can find me working within the Logistics Division at Conagra Brands as a data analyst. 
  
  I love being able to utilize the power of data to drive better business decisions & provide clearer insights.
  
  Having experience in manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain, I'm always looking to improve processes.  *(That's the IE major in me!)*
