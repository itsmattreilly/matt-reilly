title: "Airline Safety: Table Recreation"
subtitle: "Creating a dynamic table based on a static FiveThirtyEight article about airline safety"
excerpt: FiveThirtyEight is a popular data-centric website that provides articles, visuals, and information is a clean & easy-to-understand manner. A previous work, entitled "Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?" inspired the recreation of some of the visuals in a dynamic manner. I used the raw data, provided at FiveThirtyEight's github.
