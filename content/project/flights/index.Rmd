## We're going to build a map showcasing the past flight path's taken.

#### First, let's discuss folder & file set up. We'll need 3 main files:

  1. R File (.Rmd or .R)
  2. Airport IOTA Code CSV File (.csv)
  3. Custom flight excel file (.xlsx)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
![](folder.png)
          
A link for the [Airport Code CDV File](https://www.kaggle.com/miquar/explore-flights-csv-airports-csv-airlines-csv/data?select=airports.csv) is provided. *(This only contains USA domestic airport codes. International Locations need to be manually added)*
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Custom Flight excel file will be completely user created. This should feature all of the user's flights taken & include 5 columns:

  1. Date
  2. Origin City
  3. Destination City
  4. Origin Airport Code *(IATA Code)*
  5. Destination Airport Code *(IATA Code)*

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Import and clean data
Save all files to the same folder, in my example named "Flight Log".
In empty .Rmd or .R file, set working directory. Install and load the following packages into your file. 

Finally, load the 2 remaining files (.CSV and .xlsx) into the R file. 

**flight_log_raw** is the custom flight path excel file, while **airports** is the airport code and information file. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
setwd("/Users/matthewreilly/Desktop/matt-reilly/matt-reilly/content/project/flights")
```

```{r}
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
library(tidyverse)
library(sp)
library(geosphere)
library(ggrepel)

flight_log_raw <- read.xlsx('Flight Log Data.xlsx')
airports <- read.csv('airports.csv')
```

## Clean date data imported from Excel
We'll first need to modify the Date column to accurately reflect as a " date " type. Using a function from the Janitor package, `excel_numeric_to_date` function will convert excel numbers into dates. Switch the Date column in our original dataframe to be the converted date.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

```{r}
flight_log_raw$Date <- janitor::excel_numeric_to_date(flight_log_raw$Date)
```


## Create dataframes for each location
We need to clean & join the airport file (containing latitudes and longitudes) to our custom flight log excel file. We'll create 2 seperate dataframes: 1 for the origin and 1 for the destination. 

Using tidyverse principles, (%>%), select only the IATA_CODE, LONGITUDE, and LATITUDE from the airports dataframe and rename each to indicate this is FROM the origin.

*We'll need to create the same dataframe with different column names indication it's TO the destionation*


This will be called **airports_F** *(F indication "From")*


```{r}
airports_F <- airports %>%
  select(IATA_CODE, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE) %>%
  rename(From = IATA_CODE, Longitude_F = LONGITUDE, Latitude_F = LATITUDE)
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Repeat this step, creating another dataframe for the destinations. The only difference in this dataframe is the column names, these should be indicative of data going TO the destinations.

This will be called *airports_T* 


```{r}
airports_T <- airports %>%
  select(IATA_CODE, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE) %>%
  rename(To = IATA_CODE, Longitude_T = LONGITUDE, Latitude_T = LATITUDE)
```


## Join dataframes to create full To & From df
Now we need to join each newly created dataframe onto our flight log excel file, `flight_log_raw`. Using the `left_join()` function, include the flight log first and `airports_F` column second. The dataframes will merge together, combined on the column "From". 


*THIS IS IMPORTANT! Make sure there is a similar column name between each element of `left_join()`. This is what is used to "match" each dataframe together*
<p>&nbsp;</p>
```{r}
flight_log_F <- left_join(flight_log_raw, airports_F)
flight_log_F_T <- left_join(flight_log_F, airports_T)

flight_log_F_T
```
## Find every unique origin and destination
This step is for the labeling of our plot. Because the full flight log dataframe will contain duplicate or distinct cities in both the "Origin" and "Destination", we need a cleaned dataframe of only distinct cities. In a similar manner as above, we'll create 2 dataframes: 1 for the Origin, 1 for the destination.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


*THIS IS IMPORTANT! These dataframes will both contain the SAME column names. We will be joining by row, therefore requiring identical column naming conventions*

```{r}
cities_origin <- flight_log_F_T %>%
  distinct(Origin, From, Longitude_F, Latitude_F) %>%
  rename(City = Origin, Airport = From, Longitude = Longitude_F, Latitude = Latitude_F)

cities_dest <- flight_log_F_T %>%
  distinct(Destination, To, Longitude_T, Latitude_T) %>%
  rename(City = Destination, Airport = To, Longitude = Longitude_T, Latitude = Latitude_T)

cities_df <- distinct(rbind(cities_origin, cities_dest))

cities_df
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Pull background data to create map

Create a variable pulling the "world" mapping data. To highlight countries that have been traveled to, mutate a new column onto the "world" data including countries that have been traveled to. In my example, "USA" & "UK" are the countries traveled too.

The first color, **"#c2e3ff"**, is the HEX value of our highlighted countries. All unvisited countries will default to the 2nd color, or **"lightgray"** in this instance.
```{r}
world <- map_data("world")
world <- mutate(world, fill = ifelse(region %in% c("USA", "UK"), "#c2e3ff", "lightgray"))
```
# Construct the Plot
Next, we will construct the actual plot. There are 4 main "geom"-layers to create this plot: 

  1. the map `(geom_map())`
  2. the points `(geom_point())`
  3. the curves `(geom_curve())`
  4. city labels `(geom_text())`
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For the base map, our established **world** variable is the input data. Corresponding longitude and latitude are the x & y axes. The fill is equivalent to the fill column in our **world** dataframe, established in our section above. 

For both the points and curve, use the full `flight_log_F_T` dataframe, with longitude and latitude as the x & y axes. Ensure *inherent.aes* is FALSE for each the **geom_point** functions.

To zoom in on a certail region, use **coord_cartesian** and set X & Y limits corresponding to the longitudes and latitudes wanted. Finally, use our distinct cities dataframe, **cities_df**, as the data for text on the plot. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
```{r}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = world, map = world,
           aes(long, lat, map_id = region, fill = fill),
           color = "black", size = 0.1) + 
  scale_fill_identity() + 
  geom_point(data = flight_log_F_T, mapping = aes(Longitude_F, Latitude_F), inherit.aes = FALSE) + 
  geom_point(data = flight_log_F_T, mapping = aes(Longitude_T, Latitude_T), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_curve(data = flight_log_F_T, aes(x = flight_log_F_T$Longitude_F,
                                        y = flight_log_F_T$Latitude_F,
                                        xend = flight_log_F_T$Longitude_T,
                                        yend = flight_log_F_T$Latitude_T, alpha = 0.4), 
             angle = 80, size = 0.8) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-150, 10), ylim = c(0, 80)) + 
  geom_text_repel(data = cities_df, aes(Longitude, Latitude, label = City), size = 3.5) +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "") + 
  ggtitle("Flights of 2018 - 2021", subtitle = "Hoping to coquer the skies more!")
