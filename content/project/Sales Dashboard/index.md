This sales dashboard displays Sales  KPI's for a bicycle supplier with customers across the US. This predictive dashboard is built using Shiny, with a back-end powered in R. It connects to a database, where all information is stored.

It allows aggregation by date range, bike type, bike family, and customer. This was the cap-stone project for the "Predictive Dashboarding" Web Applications course by BusinessScience.io.
