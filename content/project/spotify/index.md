## [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) offers vast amounts of data on artists and listeners alike.

### Introduction


#### As an avid music listener, I'm always interested in my yearly "Wrapped" listening summary. <br><br> I've decided to do a deeper analysis on this history and utilize Spotify's API to uncover insights from a different perspective. 

```toml
# please replace with a valid Formspree form id or email address
formspree_form_id: your@email.here
```

Update that file and you're ready to begin receiving submissions. Just submit
the active form for the first time, and complete the email address verification
step with Formspree, and your contact form is live. The next time someone
fills it out, the submission will land in your inbox.

### Multiple Layouts

The files included with the theme have a contact page ready for copy/paste, or
you can type `hugo new forms/contact.md` and you're off to the races. There are two
layouts for `forms` – `split-right`, and `split-left` – you guessed it, one puts
the form on the right and the other on the left. You just fill out the front
matter, and the rest is automatic.

```toml
# layout options: split-right or split-left
layout: split-right
```

Both layouts display the page title and description opposite the form, and you
can also choose to show your social icon links if you have those configured in
the `config.toml` file.
