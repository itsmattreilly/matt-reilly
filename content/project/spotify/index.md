## Introduction


#### As an avid music listener, I'm always interested in my yearly "Wrapped" listening summary. <br><br> I've decided to do a deeper analysis on this history and utilize Spotify's API to uncover insights from a different perspective. 

I chose to create 2 different "mini" projects:
  - An interactive chart on my top Spotify Artists *(Interactive)*
  - A Unsupervised ML Analysis *(EDA & PCA)*
